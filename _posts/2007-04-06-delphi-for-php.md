<blockquote>For a first version of this PHP IDE, I think Borland/CodeGear did very well, but there is plenty of room for improvement.

If you have been a big fan of Delphi for Windows desktop applications, you will certainly love Delphi for PHP.

Even if you dislike the choices that were made when it comes to the generated code or then library packages, Delphi for PHP may still be very useful for developers than need to quickly create a prototype of a PHP application and show how it looks to potential or current customers.</blockquote>
