<strong>转会中心</strong>
对于俱乐部玩家，控制进行中的专业与租借报价的新方法，包括买入和卖出。比较报价、同意或拒绝更轻松。

<strong>比赛引擎的改进</strong>
重大改进后的比赛引擎，再次使用前爱尔兰共和国国家队队员ray houghton的足球智慧，同时也采纳其他现实教练的手段，达到电脑游戏对现实足球的最精确的模拟。在赛季前修改球场宽度以适应不同球风也成为可能。

<strong>评奖</strong>
新的评奖同不仅是更精确，新的奖项诸如欧洲金靴、从所有国家和队伍中选出的最佳11人也被添加。

为反映现代足球的变化，SI更新了08的财政系统，以更好的反映日新月异的足球世界，对经理们的更多的信息，包括并不止于，合作比赛收入、出票情况新闻、投资基金、改进的赞助、比赛奖金，并可以将薪酬预算用于转会交易（反之亦然）。总之，能帮助你打造理想的队伍。

<strong>球迷日</strong>
董事会可以组织球迷日，以聚拢人气，增加上座率。对于出票低迷或是缺乏竞争力的比赛，能增加上座率。
